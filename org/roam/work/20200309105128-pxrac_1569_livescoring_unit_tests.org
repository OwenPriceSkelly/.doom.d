** [[file:~/Repositories/livescoringapi/conftest.py][conftest.py]]
** [[file:~/Repositories/livescoringapi/tests/test_livescoring.py][tests/test_livescoring.py]]
* Notes:
** The [[file:20200309102844-pxrac_1969_odds_contract_fix.org][recent change]] to the odds payload means we're going to need to update how the triggering works (on the odds end)
*** This is a block for the unit tests, since it's the body of the /trigger-livescoring PUT call
*** Fixtures needed:
Need to set up test odds server, etc?

* Acceptance Criteria:
** [ ] create a conftest.py with dynamodb tables as fixtures using moto. (why moto?)
** [ ] test the end to end api calling using mocker (similar to Odds API)
** [ ] validate API calls are returning correct data  (Sign off by modelling and bet)
