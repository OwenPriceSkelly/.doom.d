- Currently unable to deploy to dev.
- Naively trying to mimic changes made in featureAPI and livescoringAPI was
  really the best I was able to do here, tbh would be more surprised if it
  worked.
*** [[file:20200324143118-pxrac_2013_oddsapi_use_standard_tf_module.org][pxrac-2013-oddsapi-use-standard-tf-module]]: Waiting
- Same approach as raceAPI, but additionally blocked waiting for apps-common
  update 0.1.14 to make it to nexus.
- As with raceAPI, would be surprised if it works without someone more
  experienced cleaning up after my first attempt.
