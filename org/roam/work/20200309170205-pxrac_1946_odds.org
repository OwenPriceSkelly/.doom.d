* Notes:
** Started [[file:2020-03-09.org][2020-03-09]]
*** Naive search/replace to change all info calls to debug
*** created and tested decorator class to time functions
*** wrapped all lib_odds functions
** NOTE: should the behavior be to simply overwrite on subsequent calls or do we want to keep everything?
*** as of [[file:2020-03-10.org][2020-03-10]], clears cache after each info log
