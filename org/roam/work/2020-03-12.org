- livescoringAPI
  - 295 issues, due to "error on call to get race start info" (response code 204)
- featuresAPI
  - 1276 issues, due to "unregistered task of type 'NAR_PRE' etc."
  - Should be ok even with these issues
- racecard ETL pipeline
  - All good
- PredictionAPI 288 issues
  - 436 issues, due to exception thrown during decompression "_lzma.LZMAError:
    Corrupt input data" and "data ended before end-of-stream marker was reached"
- RaceAPI
  - All good
- OddsAPI
  - 43 issues (all from wed, none today), due to "502 Bad Gateway" when triggering livescoring
  - Note: I think this is the result of restructuring the payload in [[file:20200309102844-pxrac_1969_odds_contract_fix.org][pxrac-1969-odds-contract-fix]]
